## Is This Offer Right for Your Business?

The $695 annual fee for the Business Platinum Card® is substantial, but the card comes packed with premium travel and business benefits that can easily offset this cost for the right user. These include:

*   **Airport Lounge Access:** Comprehensive access to the American Express Global Lounge Collection®.
*   **Travel Credits:** Various statement credits for airline fees, Dell technologies, Indeed, Adobe, and wireless services.
*   **Hotel Elite Status:** Complimentary Gold status with Marriott Bonvoy™ and Hilton Honors™.
*   **Purchase Protections:** Extended warranty, purchase protection, and return protection.
*   **5X Points on Flights and Prepaid Hotels:** Booked on amextravel.com.

The key consideration is whether your business's spending patterns align with the offer requirements and if you can leverage the card's extensive suite of benefits. The 150,000 Membership Rewards® points alone can be valued at $3,000 or more when transferred to airline and hotel partners, making this offer exceptionally lucrative.

## Important Considerations

*   **Eligibility:** This offer is typically available to new Business Platinum Card® applicants who have not had this card before.
*   **Spending Thresholds:** The $20,000 spend for points and $2,500 for the statement credit are significant. Ensure these are achievable within your normal business operations to avoid overspending.
*   **Offer Expiry:** The offer is stated to expire on **June 30, 2025**. Interested businesses should act promptly.

This new offer from American Express positions the Business Platinum Card® as a top contender for businesses looking to maximize rewards and travel perks. As always, carefully review the terms and conditions before applying.
